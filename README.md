# LearningPython
Learning Python through the CurseemVideo course by professor Gustavo Guanabara.

In this course I learned about Python history, how to install software and basic Python fundamentals divided into three parts, plus 115 exercises that were solved.

In the first part, the following themes were addressed: primitive types, arithmetic operators, modules, string manipulation and conditions.
In the second part, the following themes were addressed: nested conditions; for, while and while repeating structures True.
In the third part, the following themes were addressed: tuples; lists; dictionaries; functions; modules and packages; errors and exceptions.
